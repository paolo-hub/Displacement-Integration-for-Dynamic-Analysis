This Python script allows for the integration of an accelerogram to obtain the temporal history of displacement.

## Description

In dynamic structural analyses, a very dense sampling of the accelerogram is typically used, in the order of hundredths of a second. When performing a dynamic analysis using a temporal history of displacements, the sampling interval must be denser. This script automatically generates a temporal history of displacements with a sampling interval one-tenth of that of the input accelerogram. It is also possible to specify initial boundary conditions in terms of displacement and velocity."
